# Finance

A finance application that I built for my personal use, which fits exactly my
usage.

Supports:

- import transactions from ING Bank
- attach (multiple) cost centers to transactions
- manage virtual accounts to use one account for multiple purposes
- attach cost centers and virtual accounts automatically to transactions by
  defining rules

## Usage

```
sail up -d
```

Then visit your browser at `http://localhost/nova` and create an account.
